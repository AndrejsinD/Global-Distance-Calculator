**Author**: David Andrejsin

**Section**: A

**Term**: Spring 2019

---

## Milestone 1: Setup, Planning, Design
*Due Wednesday, 4/17, by the start of class.*

**Project selection**: Choose Your Own Adventure

‚ùóÔ∏è**Completed CRC card for the class you will implement**:
  - See this link for a sample CRC card and a template to
  use for your own cards (you will have to make a copy to edit): https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JE_3Qmytk_JGztRqkPXWACJwciPH61VCx3idIlBCVFY/edit?usp=sharing
  - Tables in markdown are not easy, so we suggest saving your CRC card
  as an image and including the image(s) in the README. You can do this
  by saving an image in the repository and linking to it. See the sample CRC card below - and replace it with your own.
